i. Interest of content - Outstanding.
    It seems like good stuff

ii. Consistency and quality of visual presentation - Excellent.
    Only issues I have are the Education page heading is a larger font size to the others, and doesn't display on mobile very well, and the text directly under it runs right to the edge of the page with no margin. Also on all pages, the fixed bottom covers up half of the bottom line of text, and the github names are hard to see as they are dark blue font on light blue background. i like the colour scheme and layout though. And it mostly scales well to smaller screens

iii. Quality of written presentation - Outstanding
    It's written well.

iv. Validity of HTML - Exemplary
     the <div class="container-fluid"> element on line 43 of eductaion is missing a closing tag. All other pages give no errors when put through a validator.

v. Evidence of collaboration - Very Good
    Everyone has made commits and added stuff. About author section doesn't really give much information about them. Looks like it was finished at the last minute (commits at 3:40 this morning, and during practical today). But you've all worked on the page.
