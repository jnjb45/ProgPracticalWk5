		<div class="row">
			<div>
				<p>Whilst maybe not at first, technology has now become an integral part of education both in and out of the classroom. Due to the large number of positives and negatives around technology in education opinions 
				were generally very divided. However, with technology in  general playing a greater and greater role in our society over the last few decades, educational bodies and systems have been forced to accept its use. This has lead to 
				both the rate and depth at which we learn vastly increasing, undoubtedly having a postivie impact on education overall. More specific examples and reasons are outlined below.</p>

				<p>It is evident that technology is vastly popular amongst children- in the UK, according to RJI, in 2015 <q>38 percent of children under 2 used a mobile device for media</q> and this figure is rising. 
				This is an astonishing statistic and shows the impact that technology is going to have on future generations as children develop at an extremely fast rate, and their environment has a large impact 
				on their outcomes. This does not have to be a bad thing- technology has to change the direction of education as it is what children will be accustomed and used to and what they will enjoy. The 
				pedagogic potential of technology is huge as a result. Technology has already improved productivity in the business world, medical world and entertainment world and there is little reason to not 
				predict the same occurring in education. It also has the potential to advantage those students who are disadvantaged in the present education system such as with not judging a work on the physical 
				writing but the content, or for those with dyslexia the colour of the background can be changed so visual stress is reduced. It also provides greater access for people all over the world to a vast 
				amount of resources, so that someone in the poorest area of the world may receive the same education as someone in America.</p>

			<div class="col-lg-6">
				<p>This will be good for the whole of humanity, as these areas are often locked in a poverty cycle which means that good education is the only means to escape, but up to this point they have been 
				denied this basic right. These are only what we have at present- there are no bounds to technology&#39s <!-- missing semi colon --> potential, and its expansion.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>A specific example is programs designed for presentations, such as powerpoint, that have enabled teachers to show concepts visually. This makes them much easier to grasp and understand. Presentations made with these programs can also be
					saved and repeatedly reused. This means that teachers have to spend less time in each lesson creating the same visual .</li>
					<li>With the advance in technology has come the internet, this has enabled information to be shared on a very large scale. In the case of education it has enabled teachers to teach students in a series of ways:
					<ul>
						<li>Through posting educational videos on platforms such as youtube</li>
						<li>Over video call using programs such as skype</li>
						<li>Through sharing educational documents such as newspapers and scientific articles</li>
					</ul>
